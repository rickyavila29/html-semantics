## Post-Assigment Review

This is the first assigment in class so there wasn't a lot of issues trying to problem solve with the code.
The main issue I discovered was the search optimization button woud not re-direct you at all while the others did.
It was a simple fix by adding the id tag "About" in the seearch opt. div element allowing the href to do its job.
I think the main purpose of this assigment was to make sure we understood the semantics of the code enough to identify
that small of a problem as well as being to submit the homework via github through pushing it up through the terminal.
